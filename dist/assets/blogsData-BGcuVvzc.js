It establishes the first comprehensive federal framework to regulate stablecoins in the United States.",image_url:"https://tago.cash/api/fetch-image/2521a45a-4002-4dc0-bb0f-7a6b18c4d715.png",content:`
            <p>The GENIUS ACT was signed into law on July 18 by President Donald Trump. It establishes the first comprehensive federal framework to regulate stablecoins in the United States, and brings long-awaited clarity to the growing market for U.S. dollar-pegged tokens.</p>
            <p>Just weeks after being signed into law, this regulatory clarity has pushed the stablecoin market cap up an additional $18 billion, from about $260 billion on July 18 to over $278 billion by Aug. 21, a nearly 7% jump in just over a month.</p>
            <h3>Clarity After Years of Obscurity</h3>
            <p>After years of “no law”, Gainsler vs Crypto ad-hoc legal wranglings, the GENIUS Act was the peace maker that shepherded through Congress by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and passed with rare bipartisan consensus, mandates that all so-called payment stablecoins be backed one-to-one by low-risk assets — namely cash or U.S. Treasury bills — subject to monthly attestations by a Big Four auditor and ongoing Bank Secrecy Act obligations.</p>
            <h3>Surprise winners: Yield-Bearing Tokens</h3>
            <p>Since the stablecoin legislation was signed into law on July 18, total stablecoin supply globally climbed by almost 7% — a marked acceleration compared to the 1% monthly drift observed in the first half of 2025.</p>
            <p>Tether’s USDT — by far the largest stablecoin by market cap — alone has added over $7 billion to its circulating supply, keeping its more than 60% market dominance, and boasting a market cap of over $167 billion as of Aug. 21 — a 4.3% increase since GENIUS became law.</p>
            <p>The supply of the largest yield-bearing stablecoin, Ethena (USDE), increased even more notably, growing by around $6 billion over the same interval, or 107% — from $5.6 billion to $11.6 billion. The sharp increase since GENIUS’s signing signals burgeoning demand for stable tokens with built-in yield, despite the U.S. legislation’s ban on such products. It is also worth noting that USDE's issuer, Ethena Labs, is from Portugal, not a US company.</p>

            <p>In fact, Anthony Yim, co-founder of analytics firm Artemis, noted in an X post earlier this month that yield-bearing stablecoins are emerging as the “surprising winners” since the GENIUS Act was approved, with supplies surging, despite being restricted in the U.S. under the proposed bill. Per the legislation — which is explicitly focused on USD-pegged stablecoins designed for payments — stablecoin issuers cannot directly offer yield to holders.</p>
            <p><em>Yield-bearing stablecoins over time, as of Aug. 4. Source: X.com</em></p>
            <p>Among stablecoins from U.S. issuers, PayPal's PYUSD is the largest yield-bearing token. Its supply has also risen sharply over the last month, growing 35% from $885 million to $1.2 billion as of today. PYUSD skirts the GENIUS Act's yield restrictions by separating out the issuer and the yield offerer — PYUSD is actually issued by New York-based Paxos Trust Company, while payments giant PayPal pays out yield to holders.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Circle, the largest U.S.-based stablecoin issuer and second-largest globally, saw the supply of its non-yield-bearing USDC grow about 4% since signing. USDC supply at first grew from $64 billion on the eve of the GENIUS Act to over $67 billion.</p>
            <p>On Wall Street, JPMorgan has also forecasted that the stablecoin market could swell to $2 trillion, propelled by tokenized payments, cross-border settlements, and programmable finance use cases.</p>
            <p>As supplies climb, smaller issuers face a tough decision. The GENIUS Act requires those with more than $10 billion in assets to either obtain a federal charter — a costly and lengthy process — or halt growth.</p>
            <h3>Charting the Course Ahead</h3>
            <p>With the regulatory scaffold now in place, attention turns to the GENIUS Act’s broader economic ripple effects.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, international developments are accelerating in the wake of the GENIUS Act. The European Union’s MiCA regime and Hong Kong’s new stablecoin guidelines have developed in parallel to the U.S. model, prompting global issuers to reassess compliance frameworks on a multi-jurisdictional basis. Meanwhile, just this week, Wyoming became the first U.S. state to issue its own stablecoin.</p>
            <p>The economic impact of the GENIUS Act is undeniable. Good or bad is a judgement left for tomorrow.</p>

            <p><strong>In brief:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Federal Reserve has ended a supervisory program that monitored banks involved in crypto.</li>
                <li>U.S. banks will no longer face increased scrutiny for offering things like crypto custody or stablecoin services.</li>
                <li>The Fed's move comes as the regulatory landscape in the U.S. changes under Trump.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <p>The Federal Reserve has ended a supervisory program aimed at monitoring U.S. banks offering crypto services, its board said Friday.</p>
            <p>America's central bank back in 2023 forced banks involved in crypto and other fintech activities to notify the Fed and follow strict guidelines.</p>
            <p>"Since the Board started its program to supervise certain crypto and fintech activities in banks, the Board has strengthened its understanding of those activities, related risks, and bank risk management practices," the U.S. central bank said in a statement, adding that it was rescinding the program.</p>
            <p>"Novel" activities, such as crypto asset custody and offering stablecoin or tokenization services, will now be monitored through the "normal supervisory process" rather than a specialized program with stricter guidelines, the Federal Reserve Board said. Friday's announcement comes after the central bank in April withdrew two similar supervisory letters that previously limited the ability of U.S. banks to engage in crypto services.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve in August 2022 and August 2023 originally issued guidance to banks getting involved in crypto, distributed ledger technology, and "complex, technology-driven partnerships with nonbanks" as a way to reduce risk.</p>
            <p>Back then, the Fed said that "the risks associated with innovation" needed to be addressed and that banks wanting to do things like crypto custody needed to be closely supervised.</p>
            <p>Today’s order specifically addresses the Novel Activities Supervision Program the Federal Reserve created in August 2023, which placed U.S. banks under unique monitoring if they engaged in crypto services. Besides stablecoins and custody services, U.S. banks were subject to enhanced supervision if they “concentrated in providing traditional banking activities such as deposits, payments, and lending to crypto-asset-related entities and fintechs.”</p>
            <p>U.S. regulators became wary of the crypto industry and its entanglements with the broader financial sector following the 2022 collapse of digital asset exchange FTX and the failure of a number of small banks in 2023—including crypto-friendly Signature Bank.</p>
            <p>For years, crypto industry leaders decried banking regulatory policy in the U.S. as a systematic and coordinated attempt to deny banking services to digital asset companies and limit their growth. The alleged scheme became known as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” which borrowed its name from the Barack Obama-era “Operation Choke Point”—an initiative that sought to debank firearm dealers, payday lenders, and other “high risk” businesses.</p>
            <p>But since President Donald Trump took office in January, regulators have adopted a more friendly approach to the digital asset industry. The SEC, for instance, is under new leadership and has scrapped several lawsuits against digital asset companies filed during the Joe Biden administration.</p>

            <h3>Stablecoins reached 45% amongst merchants who accept crypto payments</h3>
            <p>Stablecoin usage amongst crypto payments has grown from about 7% in 2020 to 57% in the first half of 2025. At the same time, reliance on USDT has gradually declined from 100% in 2019 to 96% in 2025, showing that merchants are increasingly diversifying toward Circle USDC.</p>
            <p>The surge in stablecoin adoption represents a fundamental change in how businesses and consumers approach cryptocurrency transactions. “Stablecoins are becoming the preferred choice for both merchants and customers. TagoCash provides a natural migration path for both individuals and businesses“, says Mack Coulibaly, the founder of TagoCash.</p>
            <h3>Stablecoins represent payment stability</h3>
            <p>The digital dollar offers a compelling value proposition by combining the speed and flexibility of cryptocurrency with the price stability of traditional fiat currencies.</p>
            <p>For merchants operating in volatile markets, USDC stablecoin eliminates the concern of receiving payments that could lose significant value between transaction and settlement. This predictability has made stablecoin digital payments more attractive to enterprises and merchants worldwide.</p>
            <h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
            <p>Traditional payment systems are fragmented, slow, and expensive—especially across borders. TagoCash eliminates hidden hops by pairing bank connectivity with stablecoin settlement and intuitive user experience. The result: seconds-fast transfers, clear fees, and audit-ready records.</p>
            <p>“For businesses and merchants, cash flow is oxygen,” added Coulibaly. “TagoCash gives small shops and global enterprises the same superpower: get paid faster, with less friction, and reconcile in minutes—not days.”</p>
            <h3>Looking forward</h3>
            <p>Over the next 12 months, TagoCash plans to introduce the following merchant & business features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Additional fiat corridors and payout partners, plus expanded EUROC coverage</li>
                <li>TagoPay POS integrated with Loyverse Inventory Management with merchant dashboards for payouts, settlement, and reconciliation</li>
                <li>TagoCommerce — A companion app for merchant registers.</li>
                <li>TagoBusiness — Enterprise on-premise account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>About TagoCash:</strong> TagoCash is a closed-loop financial platform built on regulated USDC stablecoin and modern banking connectivity. TagoCash delivers instant settlement, transparent pricing, and enterprise-grade compliance for people and businesses worldwide.</p>

            <h3>The SEC Classifies Stablecoins as Cash</h3>
            <p>Certain stablecoins, like Circle USDC, are now officially classified as cash equivalent by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through interim guidance released Monday August 4th, 2025.</p>
            <p>The regulatory shift permits qualifying USD-pegged stablecoins like TagoCash (Circle USDC) to be treated as cash equivalents on corporate balance sheets, will potentially trigger massive institutional adoption. This development strengthens regulation clarity and accelerates institutional adoption under SEC crypto guidance.</p>
            <h3>GENIUS Act Enables Bank & Fintech Participation</h3>
            <p>The SEC guidance aligns with the recently enacted GENIUS Act, signed by President Trump in July 2025. The law formally acknowledges regulated stablecoins as cash as a new financial instrument that is not a security or commodity.</p>
            <h3>Cash Stablecoins Signal TagoCash’s Bank Involvement</h3>
            <p>These policy reforms have revolutionized accounting hurdles that have been preventing traditional financial institutions from adopting stablecoins as cash alternatives across numerous significant market segments.</p>
            <p>For banks and lenders, treating stablecoins as cash equivalents reduces compliance risk and creates room for direct involvement without regulatory uncertainty. This addresses years of hesitation that discouraged financial institutions from engaging with stablecoins as cash alternatives.</p>
            <h3>TagoCash Advantage</h3>
            <p>TagoCash, the company behind TagoCash, welcomes this long awaited development. This regulatory evolution position injects more fuel to the adoption growth TagoCash is forecasting. “We are pleased that our strategy is validated.” says Mack Coulibaly, the founder & CEO of TagoCash.</p>
            <p>Leading to this decision, TagoCash made a strategic decision to offer virtual bank accounts (VAN) to its users. TagoBridge, the virtual bank account will offer users the ability to deposit and withdraw via bank transfers. The service is expected to be live at the end of September 2025 in the United States and later in 226 countries.</p>
            <h3>The Future is Now: A Full Digital Experience</h3>
            <p>In line with TagoCash's vision to remain purely digital in the blockchain ecosystem, the official classification of the TagoCash as cash equivalent gives global legal legitimacy to TagoCash and its service offerings. This combination of GENIUS Act framework and SEC guidance creates unprecedented opportunities for mass institutional adoption of TagoCash services.</p>

            <p>Payment company Visa expanded stablecoin offerings on its settlement platform by adding support for Global Dollar USDG, PayPal USD, PyUSD, Euro Coin EURC and two new blockchain networks, Steller and Avalanche.</p>
            <p>The integration allows users to send and receive stablecoin payments through the supported blockchain networks or convert their balances to traditional fiat currency, Visa said in a press release on Thursday.</p>
            <p>Visa already offered support to Circle’s USD Coin USDC, stablecoin, while supported networks for transfer and settlement include Ethereum, Solana and the newly added chains.</p>

            <h3>Rising competition for stablecoin market share</h3>
            <p>Visa faces competition from a growing list of financial institutions that are issuing stablecoins or integrating stablecoin services for their clients.</p>
            <p>Payments and credit card company Mastercard, Visa’s direct competitor, is collaborating with crypto companies to integrate crypto payments and has already tokenized 30% of its transactions.</p>
            <p>In June, reports emerged that retail giant Walmart and tech company Amazon, which also doubles as an online marketplace, were exploring the possibility of launching their own stablecoins. Both companies do business internationally and would benefit from the reduced transaction fees and near-instant settlement times for cross-border commerce.</p>
            <p>Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has repeatedly teased plans to create a stablecoin and equip the bank with stablecoin payment rails.</p>
            <p>More recently, financial services company and banking giant JPMorgan partnered with Coinbase to allow customers the ability to link their Chase accounts directly to Coinbase and convert rewards points to USDC.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, representatives for Mastercard acknowledged that stablecoins directly threaten the payment processor business model and are a disruptive technology.</p>
            <p>In June, Noam Hurwitz, head of engineering at payments infrastructure company Alchemy, told Cointelegraph that onchain stablecoin transaction volume has surpassed that of Visa and Mastercard and is becoming the “default settlement layer” for the internet.</p>

Detailed breakdown.",image_url:"https://tago.cash/api/fetch-image/7cfd3cb8-648d-4a42-a85a-942a06428cf8.jpeg",content:`
            <p>The GENIUS Act was signed into law by President Trump on July 18th, 2025. The CLARITY ACT passed the House and is waiting for the Senate to pass before going to the President’s desk for signature. Together Genius act and Clarity bill bring several key benefits to payment platforms like TagoCash. Here's a clear breakdown with focus to our business:</p>
            <h3>1. Clear regulatory framework & credibility</h3>
            <p>GENIUS now formally defines “payment stablecoins” and establishes specific rules for issuing and custody. CLARITY sets clear jurisdiction (SEC or CFTC) for digital asset platforms, ending uncertainty around compliance.</p>
            <h3>2. Consumer protection & trust</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Strict reserve requirements: GENIUS requires stablecoins be backed 1:1 by cash or US Treasuries.</li>
                <li>Redemption priority on insolvency: TagoCash users would have top priority.</li>
                <li>Standard for custody and safeguarding assets: CLARITY mandates qualified custodians.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Enhanced market access & legitimacy</h3>
            <p>With clear SEC/CFTC rules under CLARITY, TagoCash gains full access to US banking systems, payment infrastructure, and digital asset services.</p>
            <h3>4. Operational flexibility & innovation</h3>
            <p>GENIUS allows issuers to choose state-level or federal oversight depending on their model. CLARITY gives clarity on whether TagoCash must register as a commodity or securities platform.</p>
            <h3>5. Cost & speed efficiencies</h3>
            <p>Faster transaction processing and lower fees compared to traditional banking systems are encouraged by GENIUS. This makes TagoCash services more competitive to users and businesses.</p>
            <p><strong>In short:</strong> GENIUS ACT gives TagoCash a solid legal foundation, strong consumer protections, and access to regulated financial infrastructure. CLARITY completes the picture by settling regulatory jurisdiction.</p>

            <p>The world is rapidly shifting towards a cashless economy, and digital transactions have become an essential part of our lives. In this changing landscape, stablecoin payment & remittance is emerging as a strong alternative to the traditional forms of payment and money transfers.</p>
            <h3>What is crypto remittance?</h3>
            <p>Remittance refers to the process of transferring money either as a gift or as payment. Traditionally, it has been associated with high fees and long processing times. Crypto remittance in general and stable coin in particular, works similarly to traditional fiat remittance, with the only difference being the use of fiat-pegged crypto currencies as means of transport.</p>
            <p><strong>The process involves:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sender initiates transaction by converting fiat to stablecoin.</li>
                <li>Sender transfers crypto assets to recipient’s digital wallet.</li>
                <li>Recipient can convert back into local currency.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Isn't crypto dangerous?</h3>
            <p>Manipulating crypto can be complex and dangerous. For example, sending an ERC20 coin to a non ERC20 address can result in total loss. TagoCash eliminates these risks. TagoCash completely removed any appearance of crypto and works just like your regular financial app. You do not need to know anything about crypto or blockchain.</p>

            <h3>What is Tago Platform?</h3>
            <p>Rather than platform, we refer to our project as the Tago World. Imagine a world where there is only one currency. Yes, there is No US Dollar, No Euro, No Yen, No Pound; just one currency used for all trades and commerce. That imaginary utopian world is the Tago World.</p>
            <p>The Tago world is therefore a virtual community of people connected to the Tago Platform via a single digital currency called the Tago (USDC).</p>
            <h3>Why USDC?</h3>
            <p>USDC is fiat backed and audited crypto stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It has been recognized as the digital dollar. Before the selection of the USDC, The Tago platform used it its own programmable stablecoin, called the Doxocoin, which was abandoned in 2023.</p>
            <h3>Particularities of Tago World</h3>
            <p>In this utopian Tago world, there are only partners. Relationships are established via Partnerships. Only partners can transact with each other directly, peer-to-peer (MPC). The terms of the partnership are encoded in the Tago constitution which is enforced by the platform.</p>
            <h3>Tago Partnership</h3>
            <p>"Partnership" is a commercial relationship which enables bilateral peer-to-peer transfer of assets. In TagoCash, the partnership is like a contract that establishes an encrypted link between two or more parties.</p>
